# Ch. 4
To avoid unnecessary code replication over minor changes, exercises 4.3 through 4.10 have been grouped accordingly:
* 4.4 through 4.7 and 4.9 exist in `reverse-polish-calc/`.
* * 4.3 - added to main.c
* * 4.4 - added to stack.c
* * 4.5 - I have no idea what "handling variables" is supposed to mean from the context, so I decided to implement a hashmap to store variables and then dereference them if used. 
* 4.8 exists in `4.8/`
* 4.10 exists in `4.10/`.

# k-and-r
Exercises from "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan / Ritchie. Each chapter has three subfolders:

* **examples/** - examples from the chapter text, usually written as-is.
* **exercises/** - chapter exercises.
* **faq/** - questions I ask myself to check my understanding, with my own examples.

## Source text
You can find the full 2nd edition text [here](http://cs.indstate.edu/~cbasavaraj/cs559/the_c_programming_language_2.pdf).

## Running
`gcc -std=c99 path/to/src -o out; ./out`
Tested on Ubuntu 17.04

## Incomplete exercises
Ch. 1:
* 1-14, 1-22.
* 1-20 and 1-21 were solved, but not using tab stops (which I didn't understand when I wrote the solution); they are simply written as search-and-replace algorithms for the specified characters.
Ch. 3:
* 3.3 is solved but not as cleanly as @robot-dreams 's [solution](https://gist.github.com/robot-dreams/34d10248bc474f5a4312fa72e325656a).

## Special thanks
* @robot-dreams for the many hours of help debugging and review.
